        <p class="review">Furniture arrangements can be challenging. There are so many things that need to be taken into account: traffic patterns, focal points, activities, seating needs, lighting, etc. The last thing most people want is a crowded room, but it’s important to walk the line between having a room with too much stuff in it and having a room that doesn’t have enough furniture/ functions. Fear of overcrowding often keeps floorplans (and as a result room!) a bit dull. To me, it seems more important to have the chair there rounding out the seating area, than it is to have the pathway open. When working on floorplans, sometimes you have to choose the lesser of two evils.
            When I run into this, I often think… “Should this room be a destination or a pass-through?” Most homes have rooms that need to function as both (especially homes that have additions) and of course the goal is to do both well. But the reality is that sometimes you have to lean more towards one or the other. Whenever possible, I like to lean towards the “destination” end of the spectrum because rooms are enjoyed the most when you’re in them. Of course, we notice a room when we’re passing through it or entering into it, but the most important thing is what we notice when we’re in it, experiencing it.
            You are shopping for furniture and you just found a piece you love. Then the agonizing sets in. Will it? or won’t it? Fit into your space? And even if it does fit will it look good next to that side table you bought last Christmas? That’s where augmented reality shopping apps can make a difference. They let you see what a piece of merchandise looks like in your home before you buy it or if you want to buy a new pair of eyeglasses, they can show you what the glasses look like on you without a trip to the store. The use of augmented reality is still in its infancy with only 20% of people in the US using augmented reality at least once per month. But augmented reality has the potential to change the way we shop.
            Many retailers are coming out with augmented reality apps to make it easier for you to buy the perfect item. Here are eight retailers that have augmented reality functionality in their apps.
             But these are only a few things discussed, with many of these features and details yet concealed, left at your disposal to be witnessed at the app and the website EN' DECORE!!!!
