        <h2>AUGMENTED REALITY INTO RETAIL</h2>
        <p class="name">~Fares Manzar Khan</p> <br><br>
        <p class="review">I looooove Springtime!!! One of my favourite things to do is to bring in things from my yard and put flower arrangements around my house. (Yeah, I know it’s 2021, but I still love it.) I like things to look simple & relaxed so one of my staples has always been the classic Ball jar. Whenever I see them for a great price at a thrift store or flea market, I pick them up.
For me, it is the number one thing that makes me feel good (when my home is clean and pretty) and equally the first thing that makes me feel off if things are in disarray. So how I look at it, changing up your front door/porch area with some seasonal decor love is about putting you and your family in a good mood every time you walk in and leave your home. The candles in the lanterns would be so pretty lit if you’re expecting company at night, while the gold leaf wreath says “fall” but like…glam fall to balance out the more classic stack of pumpkins. If your house has a decent-sized porch, a rustic wood bench with a fall-feeling print pillow, and just a pumpkin or two might be all you need to get into the seasonal game (and well, maybe throw in a wreath if you want to drive the point home). Then what are you waiting for? EN' DECORE has got a perfect collection of cosy and comfortable furniture which you can customize at your home. Not to mention we got augmented reality into retail. Augmented reality retail is one of the most game-changing innovations of all time. It empowers customers with the ability to visualize and customize products by interacting virtually in 3D while shopping.
Augmented reality retail lets the customers visualize myriad types of digital content and interact with the products. They can reach out, touch, view from different angles, take pictures, compare multiple designs, and much more. Thus, creating a wow effect. This leaves a lasting impression on customers’ minds and hence, enhances the brand value. In simpler terms, it provides customers with access to a world of their imagination beyond the real world.
Yes, another interior but I just love the simple, natural palette. A soft yellow wheat wreath and a rattan basket is subtle yet effective. Then what are you waiting for? Go on and try your colour that suits your home and your dreams!!!
